Total Defence involves every Singaporean playing a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong, secure and cohesive nation. When we are strong, we are able to deal with any crisis.

On 13th February 2023, Innova Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day. The theme for Total Defence Day this year is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. Our students were given the opportunity to listen to a sharing by the Singapore Police Force which elevated their awareness on SGSecure. From another sharing by our teachers, our students were also able to develop a deeper understanding of the six pillars of defence in Singapore and understand how they can contribute to each pillar of defence.

By recognising the importance of Total Defence, our students can play an active role in strengthening ourselves, our community, and our nation.

Activities were planned and conducted during Social Studies lessons and recess time to help pupils understand the importance of their role in defending Singapore. In Social Studies class, worksheets with engaging activities such as colouring, cut-and-paste, and drawing were given to our students. These worksheets successfully injected the joy of learning, thereby enhancing the overall learning experience for our students. Our P6 students were also given the SG Unite! 2.5 card game, which they enjoyed with their classmates, as well as their family back at home too. During recess, posters of different professions were displayed in the English Arcade and students were given the task to complete a worksheet with the information there. The various professions on display were tagged with the pillar of defence that they were associated with. This boosted our students’ awareness of how each profession contribute to Total Defence in Singapore.

For this year’s Total Defence Day, our school has also planned for a water rationing activity for our P3 and P6 students during their recess from 9.30 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. During their recess, water supply from the taps in the canteen was temporarily disrupted. This provides an opportunity for them to appreciate the hardship that our pioneers had gone through during the Japanese Occupation and to remind Singaporeans, especially our youths, about the importance of water saving habits as water is one of our most precious resources!
