This year, Innova Primary celebrated Chinese New Year on the 31th of January. Just like the celebrations in 2021, this year’s celebration had a mix of pre-recorded performances and live streaming delivered online via Zoom. We also invited representatives of our sister school - Nanhai Guicheng Foreign Language School in China to join our celebrations. We received many Chinese New Year’s greetings from our Innovians and from our alumni as well. We wish everyone Happy Chinese New Year and Everyone have a _Roarrrrring_ Splendid year of 2022!
