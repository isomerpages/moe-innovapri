As part of the World Book Day celebrations, all Innovians took part up in a 30-Day Reading Challenge. Students were given the Reading Challenge Card, where they had 30 reading-related tasks for the period of the challenge. The tasks in the reading challenge card are designed intentionally to allow our students to enjoy reading activities that are related to different subject areas learnt in school, for example, Science Fiction and Mother Tongue languages books. We also hope to encourage our students to develop a love for reading and spend their March holidays productively by engaging in these reading activities.
Students also wrote their individual reading goals on the Reading Challenge card to motivate them to read consistently throughout the year.
Prizes and avatar points were awarded to students who were able to complete all or at least 15 of the reading challenge tasks. Students keyed in evidence of their task completion in the Google Form that was found in the ‘IPS 30-Day Reading Challenge 2022’ SLS lesson.
