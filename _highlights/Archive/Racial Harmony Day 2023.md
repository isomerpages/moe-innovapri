As part of our National Education efforts, Innova Primary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) from 17 July to 21 July through activities and discussions to enable students to gain a deeper appreciation of racial harmony, multiculturalism, and social cohesion. The theme, Singapore's Multicultural Mosaic, highlights the strength in Singapore's cultural diversity, and the vibrant heritage of our society. 
We started off the commemoration with an assembly program on 17 July, to remind us about the events in 1964, which led to many casualties due to two communal riots. There were also recess activities for the pupils as they had a chance to play traditional games.

Classroom activities, which involved pupils in making a multicultural mosaic of our local traditional food, games, and attire, were crafted to suit the needs of the class. Although we are all different in our own way, food is a common thread that binds us all as Singaporeans. We all celebrate our local festivals together, and we all love our delicious local food.

Throughout the week, the pupils actively engaged in learning about each other's diverse cultures, fostering a sense of proactive curiosity. As our students acquire knowledge, they simultaneously develop a profound respect for and enjoyment of these cultural differences.
By the end of the week, our pupils had internalized the vital lesson that harmony among different races and religions stands as a foundational principle of our nation. This week-long commemoration allowed us to not only celebrate our rich diversity but also to mutually share in one another's customs and cultures, strengthening the bonds that unite our community.
