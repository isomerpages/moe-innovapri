今年的Chinese New Year庆祝会在1月20日举行，这是疫情以来第一次全校师生面对面齐聚大礼堂庆祝华人新年。在疫情之前，看似普通的庆祝会，在疫情之后却是如此难得。很庆幸，我们能快快乐乐地齐聚一堂举办全校性的庆祝会。
今年的新年庆祝会非常特别，因为今年是十二生肖的兔年，所以我们在校长致辞之后，由我们的特别嘉宾（一只可爱的小兔子）向校长献上卷轴，寓意我们星烁小学新年新气象，学生们的德智体“兔”飞猛进。当学生们看到如此可爱的兔子的时候，一个个都激动不已，一开始就把庆祝会推上了高潮。
接下来，由学生主持人向大家介绍华人新年的传统习俗。同学们在听完介绍后，通过抢答的方式回答老师提出的问题，并可获得奖品。
既然是庆祝会，当然少不了节目表演。我们学校华族舞蹈CCA的同学们为大家带来了一场精彩的华族舞蹈。华族舞蹈过后，新年祝福从四面八方飞来，包括在校师生的、Innova Alumni的、家长的、等等。
在新年庆祝会之前，我们还进行了一系列的classroom activities，包括新年教室布置比赛。这个时候，各个年级的教室布置比赛的赢家都上台从校长和副校长手里领取了各自班级应得的奖品。庆祝会的另一个高潮当然要数舞狮表演了，从舞狮队和财神爷踏入礼堂到离开，尖叫声和掌声就没断过，学生们也和“狮子们”有了很好的互动。这是疫情三年以来，学生们第一次这么兴奋地见到往日的舞狮表演。“狮子们“在离开之前，还祝福我们学校”五福临门、吉祥如意“。
最后，庆祝会在全校师生的大合唱中圆满落幕。


This year&#39;s Chinese New Year celebration was held on January 20th, marking the first
time since the Covid-19 pandemic that the entire school gather in the auditorium to
celebrate the Chinese New Year in-person. What used to be a seemingly ordinary
celebration has become exceptionally rare after the pandemic. We are fortunate to
be able to come together joyfully and hold a school-wide celebration.
This year&#39;s New Year celebration is particularly special because it is the Year of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. After the principal&#39;s speech, a special guest (an adorable little rabbit) presented a scroll to the principal, symbolizing a fresh start for our school and the students&#39; great progress in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.
When the students saw this cute rabbit, they were all filled with excitement, and the celebration reached its climax from the very beginning.
Next, student hosts introduced traditional customs of the Chinese New Year. After
listening to the introduction, the students answered questions raised by the teachers through a quiz format and had the opportunity to win prizes.

Since it was a celebration, performances were a must. Students from our school&#39;s Chinese Dance CCA presented a splendid performance. Following the Chinese dance, New Year blessings came from all directions, including from the teachers and students, Innova Alumni, parents, and more.

Before the New Year celebration, we also had a series of classroom activities,
including a competition for the best-decorated classroom for the New Year. The
winners of the classroom decoration competition across the different levels went on stage to receive their well-deserved prizes from the principal and vice-principal. Another highlight of the celebration was the lion dance performance. From the moment the lion dance troupe and the God of Wealth entered the hall, there were continuous cheers and applause. The students had a great time interacting with the &quot;lions.&quot; It was the first time in three years since the Covid-19 pandemic that the students were able to view the traditional lion dance live! Before leaving, the &quot;lions&quot; blessed our school with &quot;May the Five Blessings come to your door, and may you have good fortune.&quot;
Finally, the celebration concluded with a grand chorus by all the teachers and
students.
