# Earth Day & World Book Day Celebrations ‘23 

This year, Innova Primary School celebrated Earth Day and World Book Day on 20 April 2023. As part of a collaboration between the English, Science, Mother Tongue and CCE Departments, this joint celebration aimed to raise awareness among our students on the importance of reading and to also educate them about creating a sustainable environment while giving back to their community at large.  
Various activities were arranged for students to be actively involved in the celebrations this year. 

***Share a Book, Save the Earth – A Book Exchange Initiative @ IPS***

In this initiative, students were encouraged to donate unwanted books at home to the school. For each book donated, students received an IPS Avatar stamp.  Students then used the IPS Avatar stamps to exchange for another book during the book exchange which took place from 18 April 2023 to 20 April 2023.
With this book exchange initiative, our students had the opportunity to understand the value of sharing with others in their community, as well as the importance of protecting our Earth through their acts of donating and reusing the books.

***‘Write On! – Chronicles of the IPS Avatars’ Writing Competition***

Along with the tips that students had gained from our ‘Author Talk’ programme in Term 1, the ‘Write On!’ competition provided our students the opportunity to showcase their creativity and imagination, and develop their language skills to inspire them to become young authors. 
In the stories submitted, students had featured the IPS Avatars as the main characters, displaying the different avatar traits and behaviours as well as the school’s ISTAR values. Students also presented their stories which were in line with the theme of environmental issues. A total of 63 submissions were received from students across Primary 1 to Primary 6 classes. Six winners were chosen, one from every level. They were awarded for their outstanding stories which included those written in both English and Mother Languages. The winners also earned Avatar points for their respective teams. The winning stories were also shared beyond the school by our student representatives, namely with the Woodgrove community at the Woodgrove's World Environment Day event on 18th June 2023.

***Book Characters Costume-Making Competition***

In the spirit of educating students about protecting our Earth and its natural resources, students were also encouraged to dress up in their favourite book character costumes that are made using recycled materials. As with previous years, the costumes worn by both students and staff added more excitement to the celebrations. One winner from each class was selected as the ‘Best Book Character Costume’. Winners were awarded with a medal each for their marvellous efforts.
