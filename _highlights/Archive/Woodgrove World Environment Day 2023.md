**Woodgrove World Environment Day**

Woodgrove CC organized the second run of Woodgrove World Environment Day on Sunday, June 18th, 2023. This event, led by Woodgrove's Green Taskforce, aims to highlight the sustainable initiatives and projects currently implemented by various grassroots organizations, agencies, and community partners. We are proud to share that Innova Primary School showcased the sustainable projects by our talented pupils during the event as follows.

To promote sustainable living and the conservation of resources, Environmental CCA pupils embarked on an innovative upcycling project that involved creating musical instruments from recyclable materials. The project began with a plastic waste collection initiative, which allowed the students to learn how to sort the waste according to its types. The students then applied their creativity and ingenuity to make various musical instruments, including drums, shakers, and xylophones. This project is named "Eco-Grooves@IPS."

Other works showcased at the event include digital games designed by Innova's IT influencers based on environmental themes such as recycling and saving the planet, as well as environmental-themed stories written by our very own Innovians during World Book Day, using the school's avatars as characters.
Not only did our pupils share their work with the Woodgrove community, but they also had the opportunity to learn from others. It was truly inspiring to witness the various ways of sustainable living.
