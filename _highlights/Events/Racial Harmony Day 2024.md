<h1><strong>Commemoration of Racial Harmony Day @IPS</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day is a significant occasion for celebrating our diverse
cultural heritage and promoting mutual understanding and respect among
students. This year, our school organised a series of activities designed
to engage students meaningfully, emphasising the importance of harmony
and unity. Here’s a look at the exciting events that took place during
the two-week commemoration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assembly Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The commemoration began with an Assembly Programme, setting the tone for
Racial Harmony Day. The programme served as a reminder of the events in
1964, which led to many casualties due to two communal riots. Various RHD
activities were also introduced during the assembly to raise awareness
and encourage students' participation in the planned activities.</p>

<p><strong>Recess Activities: Traditional Games and Craft Making</strong>
</p>
<p>Recess was a highlight for many students as they got to participate in
traditional games that showcased our school's cultural diversity. Games
like Five Stones, Chapteh, and Top Spinning were a big hit. Additionally,
craft stations were set up for activities such as ketupat weaving, calligraphy,
oil lamp paper making, and creating Easter bookmarks. These stations, manned
by enthusiastic parent volunteers and teachers, were spread around the
school courtyard. Students loved learning and engaging in these traditional
crafts and games with their peers.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 3 Math: Financial Literacy Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 Maths teachers integrated the Racial Harmony Day theme into
their Financial Literacy Programme by conducting a Budget Planning activity
for the students. This activity reinforced mathematical concepts while
also highlighting the importance of careful planning and resource management
in organising cultural events.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies (SS) and Form Teacher (FT) Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout the two weeks, Social Studies and Form Teachers conducted lessons
on various topics, including the celebration of festivals by different
ethnic groups, traditional games, and weddings from various cultures. These
lessons aimed to deepen students’ understanding of cultural diversity and
emphasise the importance of harmonious coexistence.</p>

involved. The assembly programme, recess activities, and various lessons
conducted have played a crucial role in fostering unity, understanding,

and skills to promote inclusiveness in their daily lives.</p>
