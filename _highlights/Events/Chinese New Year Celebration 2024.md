<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2月9日，是万千华人期待已久的日子，一年一度的华人新年来了。今年，星烁小学的师生们再次共聚一堂，在欢乐声中迎接新的一年的到来。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 庆祝会开始之前，同学们在课室里了解了新年的由来和风俗习惯，也进行了一些和龙有关的手工制作和彩纸。大家利用手头的资源，互相合作，一起做出许许多多精美的作品，而这些被赋予爱和幸福做出来的作品，在星烁的各个角落高高地挂着，在课室，在办公室，还在大家的心里。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 当然，庆祝会更是必不可少的一个环节，也是最令人期待的。校长的致辞，开启了庆祝会的序幕。紧接着，一群朝气蓬勃，充满力量的武术选手冲上舞台，把庆祝会推向了第一个高潮。欢呼声和鼓掌声不断涌来，大家都被武术队精彩的表演所吸引。武术表演过后，悠扬的口琴声把大家的思绪拉了回来，还没来得及回味武术表演，口琴声伴着有节奏的拍掌声，大家一起清唱，一起感受歌曲中的新年气氛。除了同学们的精彩表演，老师也带着祝福出现在大屏幕上。尽管老师们的脸被遮住了，但这丝毫不影响大家的猜测，因为老师们的身影早已在学生们心中。一阵欢声笑语后，校领导为大家颁发了最佳课室装饰奖。“咚咚咚……”还没等大家反应过来，礼堂后面出现了一只超级可爱的“龙偶”，这再次把现场的气氛直接推向高潮，学生们和“龙偶”互动着。忽然，两只舞狮从天而降，不仅是学生们，现场的校董会成员，还有家长，都忍不住欢呼，吉祥物们给大家带来了祝福和欢笑。最后，庆祝会在全校师生的大合唱中圆满落幕。</p>
<p>On February 9th, a long-awaited day for countless Chinese people arrived—the
annual Chinese New Year. This year, the teachers and students of Innova
Primary School gathered once again, welcoming the new year amidst joyous
celebrations.</p>
<p>Before the celebration began, students learned about the origins and customs
of the New Year in their classrooms. They also engaged in various handicraft
activities related to dragons and colored paper. Utilizing available resources
and cooperating with each other, they created numerous exquisite artworks
filled with love and happiness. These creations adorned every corner of
Innova Primary School, hanging prominently in classrooms, offices, and
in everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>Of course, a celebration wouldn't be complete without its highlights and
the most anticipated part. The principal's address marked the beginning
of the festivities. Following that, a group of energetic and powerful martial
artists took the stage, elevating the celebration to its first climax.
Cheers and applause filled the air as everyone was captivated by the spectacular
martial arts performance.</p>
<p>After the martial arts display, the melodious sound of harmonica brought
everyone's attention back. Before they could fully savor the martial arts
performance, rhythmic clapping accompanied the harmonica, and everyone
joined in a clear singing, immersing themselves in the New Year atmosphere
of the song. In addition to the students' splendid performances, teachers
appeared on the big screen with their blessings. Though their faces were
covered, it didn't dampen the students' excitement as the teachers had
already made a mark in their hearts.</p>
<p>Amidst laughter and cheers, school leaders presented the Best Classroom
Decoration Award. Before anyone could react, a super adorable "dragon puppet"
appeared from back of the hall, once again lifting the atmosphere to a
new high as students interacted with the puppet. Suddenly, two lion dancers
appeared, eliciting cheers not only from the students but also from the
school board members and parents present. The mascots brought blessings
and laughter to everyone. Finally, the celebration concluded with a grand
chorus by all the teachers and students at the school.</p>
