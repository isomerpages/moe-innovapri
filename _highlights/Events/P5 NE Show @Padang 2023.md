On July 2, 2023, our enthusiastic P5 students proudly wore their red T-shirts in anticipation of the annual NE Show held at Padang. This event serves as a dynamic conduit for achieving the overarching objectives of National Education, aiming to nurture a profound appreciation of Singapore's history, values, and identity within our young learners. Moreover, it provides a unique opportunity for our students to witness the grandeur of the National Day Parade (NDP).

The NE Show was an exhilarating experience for our students. They were greeted by an impressive marching contingent, comprising various uniformed groups and representatives from social and economic sectors. The thrill of witnessing the Red Lions descending from the sky further heightened their excitement. The show wasn't just about visual spectacles; it also resonated with the heartwarming tunes of past NDP songs and this year's theme song, 'Shine Your Light.' The highlight was undoubtedly the fireworks toward the end of the NE show. Each student also received an NDP fun pack, adding to their delight and sense of belonging.

Throughout the event, the P5 students were completely immersed in the spirit of patriotism. They enthusiastically participated in the lively shows and sang along to familiar tunes, demonstrating their love and pride for Singapore. The NE Show is not merely a passive educational event; it serves as a vibrant, interactive platform that inspires young minds to embrace their roles as responsible citizens.
Designed to be engaging and interactive, the NE Show utilizes various creative formats, including storytelling, dramatic performances, and multimedia presentations, making learning about national education an enjoyable experience. It instills in our students the values of integrity, resilience, empathy, and teamwork.
As our young learners departed from the NE Show, they carried with them a deeper understanding of their roles as citizens and a heightened sense of civic responsibility. The NE Show, with its vibrant celebration of Singaporean identity and values, continues to be a pivotal event in shaping the future leaders and responsible citizens of our nation.
