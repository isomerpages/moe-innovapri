For 15 years, Innova Primary School (IPS) has been a place where dreams are nurtured, where the seeds of imagination are sown, and where the future is being shaped every day. Our beloved school has not only been a source of academic excellence but also a cradle for the aspirations of young hearts.
Today, 16 Dec 2023, we commemorate this remarkable milestone and our theme for Honour’s Day 2023 is "Together our dreams continue." These words carry a profound message that reminds us of the enduring power of unity and cooperation in the pursuit of our dreams. 

IPS Honour’s Day was a jubilant celebration of academic excellence and talent, radiating joy and pride throughout the school. Prize winners beamed with achievement as they were acknowledged for their hard work and dedication. We also celebrated the achievement of ex-Innovians who had performed remarkably in their 2022 PSLE by awarding them the Shining Stars Awards. The event saw a full turnout, with parents joining in the festivities, sharing the joyous occasion with their children. The air was filled with excitement and applause as the school showcased its diverse cultural tapestry through captivating performances. Malay Dancers, IDOL Dance members, Chinese dancers, and members of the Wushu CCA Club mesmerized the audience with their skillful and vibrant presentations. 

The event not only recognised academic achievements but also highlighted the school's commitment to fostering a rich cultural environment. In addition to that, members of the Parent Support Group (iPSG) and Friends of Innova were recognized for their continuous support to our school.
IPS Honour’s Day was a testament to the collective success of students, educators, parents, and external partners, creating lasting memories of celebration and accomplishment.
