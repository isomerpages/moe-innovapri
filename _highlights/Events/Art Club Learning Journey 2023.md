On Monday, September 18, 2023, the Art & Crafts Club CCA embarked on an exciting excursion to Kamalâ€™s Art Studio and Gallery, located at Wisma Geylang Serai.

During this visit, our students had the privilege of immersing themselves in the world of art under the guidance of Mr. Kamal Dollah, a renowned local artist and art educator. Mr. Kamal graciously welcomed our students and shared his vast knowledge while taking them on a tour of his gallery which showcased his significant contributions to both our nation and the broader community. Our students had a unique opportunity to work alongside him in his studio, witnessing the mastery of his craft firsthand.

One of the remarkable insights gained from the visit was Mr. Kamal's commitment to sustainable art practices. He demonstrated how he personally cultivated indigo bark to create organic, non-chemical-based dyes and formulated his unique color blends for his diverse artistic works.

The day was marked by meaningful interactions with Mr. Kamal, who not only showcased his artistry but also engaged our students in art demonstrations. He shared invaluable insights into the journey of becoming an artist, leaving our students deeply inspired. They explored various art forms, including batik painting, caricature, and even AI-generated art.

Furthermore, our students had a hands-on experience in textile art by crafting indigo tote bags using the tie and dye technique, all under the expert guidance of Mr. Kamal. This allowed them to create personalized tote bag designs through the Indigo Tie & Dye method.

We are delighted to share some unforgettable moments captured during the visit. This excursion was truly an engaging and enriching experience for all involved.
