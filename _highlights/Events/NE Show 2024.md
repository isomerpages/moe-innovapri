<h1><strong>NE show 2024</strong></h1>
<p>On June 29, 2024, the P5 pupils gathered in the school hall with great
excitement as they prepared for the annual NE Show at Padang. Dressed proudly
in their red T-shirts, they eagerly anticipated the event. The NE Show
aims to instill a deep appreciation of Singapore’s history, values, and
identity in our young learners, while also offering them a unique opportunity
to experience the grandeur of the National Day Parade (NDP). After attentively
listening to briefings from teachers and volunteers, the students cheerfully
collected their goodie bags and food, ready for their journey to Padang.</p>

<p>This year's NE Show, themed "Together, As One United People," celebrated
our nation’s stories by showcasing our strength, diversity, and unity through
songs, mass performances, and filmlets. Upon arriving at Padang, our P5
Innovians were filled with excitement. The show kicked off with a lively
parade featuring six mascots, a choir, a band, and a skating performance.
The thrill was heightened when the Red Lions descended from the sky. Following
this, the marching contingents entered the parade from all directions,
displaying their impressive uniforms and disciplined presence, which left
the Innovians in awe. The excitement reached its peak with the Dynamic
Defence Display, highlighting Singapore's readiness to address crises and
disruptions.</p>

<p>As night fell, mass musical performances took centre stage, accompanied
by brilliant fireworks. The Innovians sang along enthusiastically to familiar
tunes, expressing their love and pride for Singapore. As they departed,
they took with them new values and experiences that they had not encountered
before. This fulfilled the NE Show’s purpose of fostering a profound connection
and sense of belonging to our country. By witnessing Singapore's achievements,
our Innovians &nbsp;developed a deep sense of national pride. More than
just a performance, the NE Show is a cherished tradition passed down through
generations, illustrating how people from diverse backgrounds unite to
celebrate and support their nation. It instils essential values such as
resilience, empathy, harmony, and teamwork. The pupils left with a deeper
understanding of their roles as citizens and a heightened sense of civic
responsibility, helping to shape them into responsible and caring leaders
for the future.</p>
