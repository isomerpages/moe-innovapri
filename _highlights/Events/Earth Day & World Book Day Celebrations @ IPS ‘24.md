<p>This year, Innova Primary School celebrated Earth Day and World Book Day
on April 22, 2024. The English and Science departments collaborated to
organise these joint celebrations, aiming to raise awareness about the
importance of reading and educating students on creating a sustainable
environment, all while encouraging them to give back to their community.
Various activities were planned to ensure active student participation
in the celebrations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Share a Book, Save the Earth – A Book Exchange Initiative @ IPS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, students were encouraged to donate unwanted
books from home to the school. For each book donated, they received an
IPS Avatar stamp. These stamps were then used to exchange for other books
during the book exchange held from 22<sup>nd</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> April.
This book exchange initiative allowed our students to learn the value of
sharing within their community and emphasised the importance of protecting
our Earth through the acts of donating and reusing books.</p>

years, the costumes worn by both students and staff added more excitement
to the celebrations. One winner from each class was selected for the 'Best

<p><strong><u>Book Review Blitz!</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This year, our school’s Earth Day and World Book Day celebration featured
an exciting new element: the Book Review Blitz!</p>
<p>In this innovative competition, students were encouraged to team up with
a partner or buddy, which could be a parent, grandparent, sibling, friend,
or even their pet! Together, they read a book and recorded a video review,
sharing their thoughts and opinions about the story.</p>
<p>These videos were then uploaded on SLS, adding a fun and interactive twist
to the festivities. Participants had the chance to win fantastic prizes,
making the event even more engaging and memorable for everyone involved.</p>

<p>During the Earth Day and World Book Day week, students had a memorable
time at the Story Screening event held at the IPS Library. The special
storytelling session was conducted by our school librarian, Ms. Leong,
who captivated the students with her engaging stories. Carefully selected
to match environmental-related themes, these stories educated students
on the importance of taking care of the earth while fostering a love for
reading. After the storytelling, students enthusiastically participated
in a Kahoot quiz, which added a lot of excitement to the event. The thrill
of the game was palpable as students competed eagerly. At the end of the
session, the winners of the Kahoot game were delighted to receive goodie
bags filled with reading and writing materials, making the event both fun
and educational.</p>
