<p>This year, Innova Primary School celebrated Earth Day and World Book Day
on April 22, 2024. The English and Science departments collaborated to
organise these joint celebrations, aiming to raise awareness about the
importance of reading and educating students on creating a sustainable
environment, all while encouraging them to give back to their community.
Various activities were planned to ensure active student participation
in the celebrations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Share a Book, Save the Earth – A Book Exchange Initiative @ IPS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, students were encouraged to donate unwanted
books from home to the school. For each book donated, they received an
IPS Avatar stamp. These stamps were then used to exchange for other books
during the book exchange held from 22<sup>nd</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> April.
This book exchange initiative allowed our students to learn the value of
sharing within their community and emphasised the importance of protecting
our Earth through the acts of donating and reusing books.</p>
