<p><strong>Total Defence Day 2025: Together We Keep Singapore Strong</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Innova Primary School, we stand united in our commitment to keeping
Singapore strong. Each year, Total Defence Day (TDD) is commemorated on
15 February to remind us of the importance of safeguarding our nation’s
security, peace, and resilience. This day marks the fall of Singapore to
the Japanese in 1942, serving as a powerful lesson on the challenges our
nation has overcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, the theme "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" reinforced the
idea that everyone, regardless of age, has a role in defending our country.
Through a series of immersive activities, our students explored the six
pillars of Total Defence—Military, Civil, Economic, Social, Digital, and
Psychological Defence—and discovered how they can contribute to a safer
and stronger Singapore.</p>
