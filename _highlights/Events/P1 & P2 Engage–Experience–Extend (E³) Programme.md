<h1><strong>P1 &amp; P2 Engage–Experience–Extend (E³) Programme</strong></h1>
<p>This year, our P1 and P2 students took part in a three-day integrated
learning experience held during the PSLE marking days. Designed to strengthen
the purpose and integration of the Learning Journeys, the E³ programme
provided our students with opportunities to <strong>Engage</strong>, <strong>Experience,</strong> and <strong>Extend</strong> their
inter-disciplinary learning while nurturing their 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies such as collaboration, communication, and critical and inventive
thinking.</p>
<h4><strong>Day 1 – Engage</strong></h4>
<p>On the first day of E³, students participated in pre-journey activities
that sparked their curiosity about the parks and animals that they would
encounter. Key concepts already learned in their various subjects were
revisited in a new context.</p>

<h4><strong>Day 2 – Experience</strong></h4>
<p>On Day 2 of the E³ programme, our students visited the Zoo (P1) and River
Wonders (P2). Students had an authentic experience at the parks with their
classmates and put into practice the concepts and habits that they had
learned on Day 1. At the respective parks, students observed, questioned,
and collected data. They also engaged in meaningful conversations with
each other and with the park keepers on what it means to care for the animals
and the environment.</p>

<h4><strong>Day 3 – Extend</strong></h4>
<p>On the final day of the E³ programme, students engaged in post-journey
activities to consolidate learning, reflect on character values, and apply
skills such as recount writing, data analysis and creative expression.
This included various recess activities such as mass dance, obstacle courses,
origami animal folding, and handprint art.</p>
