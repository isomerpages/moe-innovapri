<h1>National Day Celebration 2024</h1>
<p></p>
<p>On 8th August, Innova Primary School became a lively hub of patriotic
spirit and unity as the entire school community came together to celebrate
National Day in spectacular fashion. Students and staff alike proudly donned
red and white tops, embodying their love and pride for the nation under
the inspiring theme for National Day 2024, "Together, as One United People."</p>

<p>Not letting the wet weather dampen our spirits, the celebration kicked
off with a vibrant and captivating parade in the school hall, where a spirited
marching contingent took centre stage. Led by dedicated school prefects,
Brownies, and Red Cross members, and joined by enthusiastic P3-P5 class
monitors, the parade embodied the essence of togetherness. The atmosphere
was charged with emotion as the school community joined in a heartfelt
rendition of "My People, My Home," a patriotic anthem that echoed the unity
and pride shared by everyone present.</p>

<p>Adding a creative twist to the celebration, students engaged in an innovative
upcycling project, transforming recycled bottles into shakers to be used
during the National Day concert. This hands-on activity not only aligned
with the theme "Together, as One United" but also highlighted the school's
commitment to sustainability and the vision of a Zero-Waste Nation. The
project showcased Innova's dedication to progress and environmental responsibility,
reinforcing the idea that unity extends beyond just people—it is about
working together for a better future.</p>

<p>As Singapore celebrated its 59th birthday, the festivities at Innova Primary
School continued with boundless energy and enthusiasm. A dynamic concert,
led by our talented P5 student emcees, featured performances by our P1
pupils, Innova Idols, and the ELDDS, with each act adding a unique artistic
flair to the event. The students’ performances paid tribute to Singapore’s
rich history, with renditions of beloved National Day Parade (NDP) songs,
connecting past and present in a celebration of national pride.</p>
