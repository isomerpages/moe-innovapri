**Nanhai Cultural Immersion Programme**

30 P4-5 students were selected for the Nanhai Cultural Immersion Programme from 22-28 May 2019.

This is a yearly programme which aims to provide an opportunity for students to have first-hand experience in a local China school while understanding their learning culture. More importantly, this programme aims to develop in students the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.

Besides attending lessons with their assigned buddy and experiencing the life of a Chinese student in a boarding school, our students were also brought on educational tours to enrich their experience.

The highlight of the trip was a homestay at their buddy's place over the weekend. In allaying our students' anxieties, the local parents arranged for class outings where their children and our students mingle and foster their friendship through fun-filled activities. This was definitely an enriching and memorable trip for our students
