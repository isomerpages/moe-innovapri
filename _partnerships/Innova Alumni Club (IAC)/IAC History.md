The Innova Alumni Club (IAC) was formed in 2010 to engage old boys and girls of Innova Primary as partners of the school to strengthen rootedness and school spirit. The interim committee was formed by former teacher, Ms Elaine Tan, and her pupils.

Mr O Kah How (Graduated in 2010) and a group of his peers formed a committee carrying out various ad-hoc activities and not until 2016 when his appointment as the first alumni Chairman was formally acknowledged. Together with Mr Chui How Yee (Graduated in 2012), they led the interim EXCO till 2018 to build and lay a stronger foundation for the alumni.

Mr Chui How Yee assumed the position of Chairman from October 2018 onwards opening a new chapter for the JAC. Mr O Kah Hao continues to support the JAC as an advisor. The EXCO seeks to continually strengthen the partnership between the school and the JAC.
