### Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM)

2020 is IPS' 10th year partnering Friend of Singa (FOS) under the Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM). The school has been presented the Participation Trophy for its collaboration and partnership.

In 2020, our school's SKM Project "Care Agents, Pass it On" was featured under the Heart-warming Community Service segment category. This award recognises the efforts of our students who have reached out to the wider community during COVID. 

Let's continue to encourage our students to be gracious, kind and helpful towards one another and the larger community!
