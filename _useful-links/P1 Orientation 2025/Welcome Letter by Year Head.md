Dear Parents / Guardians,

Thank you for joining us for the P1 Orientation. We are very heartened to see such a big turnout. Please continue to keep up your enthusiastic support for your child / ward throughout his / her primary school schooling journey in Innova Primary School.

To start you and your child / ward off right from Primary 1, we have lined up the following for you:

1) Care Corner Singapore’s Family Support Services is conducting two online workshops on 2nd Dec and 4th Dec on the topic of “Off to a Good Start! Help your child transit successfully to Primary School”. You are strongly encouraged to sign up for all the three workshops to learn useful tips on how to better support your child/ ward to transit to Primary 1. Click on this link below to sign up.
