<p>We would like to extend a warm invitation to you to join our HCIS 2025
Year 1 Admission Information Session, which will be conducted <strong>online (via Zoom) </strong>on <strong>23rd May</strong>,
from <strong>7:00pm to 8:30pm</strong>.</p>
<p>We held our #ExperienceHCIS Open House 2024 on 6th April, and based on
the feedback we gathered, some parents were unable to attend the sharing
session during the event. Therefore, we have decided to organize an information
session especially for parents of students taking the PSLE this year!</p>
<p>The topics covered in this information session will be similar to the
sharing session on our Open House day. Our School Leaders will be sharing
information on our International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP),
School Curriculum as well as Scholarship Opportunities. Please feel free
to share the event with your family and friends who may be interested to
find out more!</p>
<p>Sign up for the HCIS 2025 Year 1 Admission Information Session via the
