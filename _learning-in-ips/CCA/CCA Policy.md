<h5><u>IPS CCA Policy</u></h5>
<h5>Role of Co-Curriculum</h5>
<p>The Total Curriculum comprises the Curriculum and the Co-Curriculum. Through
the Total Curriculum, pupils receive a holistic education which provides
them with balanced development across the moral, cognitive, social-emotional,
physical and aesthetic domains.</p>
<h5>Purpose of CCA Programme</h5>
<p>The CCA Programme provides pupils with a platform to discover their interests
and talents. CCAs can fuel in the individual a lifelong love for a particular
activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual
to lead a balanced life in adulthood.
<br>Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS)
develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and
Performing Arts (VPA) instill in pupils a sense of graciousness and an
appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.
Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of pupils by
inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit
of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow pupils to explore
and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialized areas which
may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Pupils are honed in information,
communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery
of the specialized areas.</p>
<p>Pupils progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and
attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA
also offers excellent platforms for pupils to learn core values, social
and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.</p>
<p>All CCAs emphasize social interaction by providing a common space for
friendships and social integration amongst pupils of diverse backgrounds.
Through CCA, pupils develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.</p>
<h5>CCA Commitment @ IPS</h5>
<p>To encourage sustained participation and progressive development of skills,
values and attitudes through CCAs, your child / ward in Primary 3 to 6
is strongly encouraged to commit to his / her CCA for at least 2 or more
years.</p>
<p>If your child / ward does not fulfil the 2 year CCA commitment, he / she
may not be considered&nbsp;for a change in CCA until the subsequent yearâ€™s
CCA Selection Exercise. Please note that alternative requests with valid
reasons and supporting documents will be considered on a case-by-case basis
by the PE &amp; CCA department.</p>
<p>A CCA Selection Form will be issued through PG in Term 2 Week 5. Please
note that all CCA requests must be made during this CCA Selection Exercise.
No action is required if your child / ward would like to remain in the
current CCA.</p>
<p>The CCA Selection Exercise is the period where your child / ward can:
<br>1. Join a new CCA, if currently not enrolled.</p>
<p>2. Change to another CCA.</p>
<p>3. Withdraw from the current CCA.</p>
<p>Please note that all requests made are subject to limited vacancies available
in each CCA. We appreciate your understanding that we will try to accommodate
one of your child's /ward's preferred choices. In addition,&nbsp;your child
/ ward might be called upon to go through try-outs for the CCAs. Your child
/ ward&nbsp;will receive the results for the CCA Selection Exercise before
the start of Semester 2.</p>
