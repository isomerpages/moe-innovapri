<h5 style="color:black" align="center"><u>IPS CCA Policy 2022</u></h5>


<h5 style="color:black" align="left">Role of Co-Curriculum</h5>
  
The Total Curriculum comprises the Curriculum and the Co-Curriculum. Through the Total Curriculum, pupils receive a holistic education which provides them with balanced development across the moral, cognitive, social-emotional, physical and aesthetic domains.


<h5 style="color:black" align="left">Purpose of CCA Programme</h5>

The CCA Programme provides pupils with a platform to discover their interests and talents. CCAs can fuel in the individual a lifelong love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood.  
Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS) develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) instill in pupils a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society. Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of pupils by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow pupils to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Pupils are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas.

Pupils progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offers excellent platforms for pupils to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.

All CCAs emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst pupils of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, pupils develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.

<h5 style="color:black" align="left">CCA Commitment @ IPS</h5>

To encourage sustained participation and progressive development of skills, values and attitudes through CCAs, your child / ward (in Primary 1 to Primary 6) is strongly encouraged to commit to his / her CCA for at least 2 years or more.

If your child / ward does not fulfil the 2 year CCA commitment, he / she may not be considered for a change in CCA until the subsequent year’s CCA Updating Exercise (e.g. If Child A withdraws from CCA in 2020 without fulfilling the 2 year commitment, he / she will only be eligible to sign up for another CCA in 2022.) Please note that alternative requests with valid reason(s) and supporting document(s) will be considered on a case by case basis by the PE & CCA department.

Your child / ward will be issued a CCA Updating Form to fill in any necessary CCA-related request once a year. All CCA requests can only be made during this CCA Updating exercise.

The CCA Updating Exercise is the period where your child / ward can:  
  
1\. Declare his / her current CCA(s) for updating  
2\. Request to join a new CCA, if he / she does not have one  
3\. Request for a change of CCA  
4\. Request for a withdrawal from CCA

Please be reminded that if your child / ward is in P3 to P6, he / she must fulfil the required CCA commitment of at least 2 years to be eligible for change or withdrawal from his / her current CCA, if any.

Please note that all requests made are subject to vacancies available in each CCA. In addition, your child / ward might be called upon to go through try-outs for the CCAs. Your child / ward will receive the results for the respective requests in Term 3.
