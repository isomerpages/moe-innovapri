<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>When can my child/ward apply for a CCA?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The CCA Selection Exercise is held around Term 2 Week 5 annually. A form
will be sent via Parents Gateway. Your child / ward will receive the results
for the CCA Selection Exercise before the start of Semester 2.</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How many CCA choices can my child/ward submit?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>During the CCA Selection Exercise, please choose the top 5 CCAs that your
child/ward is interested in. He/She will be assigned to one of the five
chosen CCAs.</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Can I repeat the same CCA as the 5 choices for my child/ward in the CCA
Selection Exercise form?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. Failure to put 5 different CCA choices for your child/ward will result
in your CCA application being rejected. We want to encourage your child/ward
to be open to and explore the variety of available CCAs. There are limited
vacancies for each CCA. By providing up to 5 different choices, you will
help the school better assign a CCA that aligns with your child's/ward’s
interests.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How can my child/ward or I find out more about CCAs in Innova Primary
School?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Please refer to our school website. Every CCA has descriptions, pictures
and videos that show what the CCA entails. Should these not be sufficient,
do feel free to contact the CCA teacher-in-charge to find out more. Reading
up and finding out about the CCAs, especially before the CCA Selection
Exercise, will help to ensure that your child/ward make an informed decision.
This will also prevent your child/ward from being assigned into a CCA which
they are not keen in.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>When can my child/ward change or quit CCA?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Any changes to CCA can only be done during the CCA Selection Exercise
in Term 2 Week 5 to Week 7 via the form sent on Parents Gateway. However,
should your child/ward have medical condition(s) or other urgent matters
that prevent him/her from participating in CCA, do contact the CCA teacher-in-charge
to provide the necessary information so that your child/ward can be removed
from the CCA.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>My child/ward has not been attending his/her assigned CCA. He/She does
not have medical condition(s). What happens to his/her attendance?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>CCA attendance is reflected in the students’ report book. Your child/ward
is expected to attend the CCA as assigned. CCA teachers will be checking
on your child’s/ward’s attendance to ensure that it is regular, similar
to daily school attendance. Should your child/ward miss CCA sessions without
valid reason(s), his/her poor attendance will be recorded and reflected
accordingly. Subsequently, your child/ward will be removed from the CCA
to ensure that more committed students can replace him/her.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How is my child/ward selected for a CCA</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A balloting system is used to assign your child/ward to one of the CCAs
of their choice. Through the balloting system, not only do we ensure fairness,
but we also ensure that each CCA has a good mix of students from different
genders, levels, classes etc. In addition, we keep the cohort size of the
CCAs in alignment to the available resources in the school e.g. space and
teachers available for each CCA, to ensure that the CCA runs safely and
effectively.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What is the CCA Policy for?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The CCA Policy is to enable Primary 3 – Primary 6 students to stay committed
to their assigned CCAs for at least 2 years. This is to give a fair and
sufficient chance to each CCA to holistically develop your child’s/ward’s
knowledge, skills and values.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>When are Primary 6 students excused from attending CCA?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Primary 6 students are excused from attending CCAs by the end of Term
2. This is to give them time to concentrate on their academic pursuits
and gear up for PSLE. At the same time, it also allows the school to take
in new batches of students in each CCA.</p>
<p>Primary 6 students are more than welcomed to continue contributing to
their CCAs post-PSLE.</p>
