**The IPS Avatars: Dynamic and inspiring characters that shape well-rounded individuals 
**

Meet the IPS Avatars - Blazer: The Orator; Glider: The Explorer; Flipper: The Entrepreneur and Leaper: The Innovator. These unique school-based Avatars embody specific behavioral traits and skills that we encourage all Innovians to develop. 

In addition, we foster a strong sense of belonging and camaraderie through Avatar team representations and Avatar activities.  Thus, our Avatars not only represent key qualities but also promote interaction among students and staff groups. They play a crucial role in fostering teamwork and healthy competition through engaging platforms like Innofiesta, Spelling Bee, and more. Avatar-based initiatives are also designed to encourage positive learning dispositions among our students.
