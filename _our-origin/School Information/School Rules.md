#### **B) HOMEWORK POLICY**

**<u>Definition of Homework</u>** <br>
Homework refers to any learning activity that pupils are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. It contains an element of completion of written assignments and independent work/study in that teachers are not usually directly involved in the supervision.

**<u>Value of Homework</u>** <br>
Homework when given appropriately can enable pupils to:

*   consolidate and extend learning
*   monitor their progress in learning
*   learn independently
*   develop good study habits and skills
*   inculcate self discipline, personal organisation and responsibility

**<u>Role of pupils</u>** <br>
Pupils can benefit from homework by doing the following:

*   Refer to the whiteboard in the classroom and record the homework assignments into the Pupil’s Handbook as part of their daily routine
*   Ensure they understand what needs to be done for all the given homework assignments
*   Do not be afraid to seek help from classmates, friends or teachers if they face any difficulty
*   Ensure that the homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school (e.g. under the table or in their locker)
*   Attempt all questions given with the best effort
*   Organize their textbooks, workbooks, worksheets and files systematically
*   Engage in independent study when there is no written assignments/ after their written assignments have been completed
*   Set their priority right and manage time well to ensure that homework is completed and submitted on time
*   Having a neat study area at home, away from distractions such as the television and the computer
*   Reviewing feedback from teachers on homework submitted

**<u>Roles of Parents</u>** <br>
Parents play an important role in their children’s education. In relation to homework, parents play a major role by monitoring their progress and providing encouragement. Parents need to show an interest in the child’s school and homework. Parents can support the school’s homework policy:

*   checking the child’s Pupil’s Handbook daily to view the homework assignments for the day
*   spending time to supervise/ go through your child’s school work; do not do the work for your child
*   ensuring your child engages in independent study when there is no written assignments/ after their written assignments have been completed
*   creating a home environment conducive for studying and completion of homework
*   showing an interest in supervising and providing support for their child’s learning
*   working in partnership with teachers to support child’s learning and development

**<u>Other Guidelines on Homework</u>** <br>
The school will not give out homework during festive periods during term time e.g. Chinese New Year, Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa.

**<u>Type of Homework</u>** <br>
Homework is varied in type in accordance with the needs of pupils and the objectives of the subject. Some general ideas for effective homework could include the following:

*   Complete activity books, learning sheets etc
