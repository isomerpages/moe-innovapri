Message from Principal
----------------------

_**Warmest greetings to all and welcome to Innova Primary School**_

On behalf of the school, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our outgoing principal Ms Winders, for bringing Innova Primary School to where it is today. Under her stewardship, the school progressed from being a very young school to a well-established member of the community. Ms Winders was originally supposed to retire two years ago but instead chose to extend her retirement and brought the school through two very tough years of managing COVID-19 in the school, keeping our pupils and staff safe. Therefore I would like to offer my heartiest congratulations to Ms Winders for being able to finally enjoy her retirement and to embark on a new chapter of her life.

In the short time that I have joined the school, I have seen my colleagues working very hard to keep pupils in the school safe from COVID-19, juggling their teaching duties with all the Safe Management Measures. But all their efforts would be naught without the cooperation and partnership of parents. While we are not out of the woods yet, there is light at the end of the tunnel as we strengthen our defences against COVID-19 with the availability of vaccination for our P1 to P5 pupils.

As we start the new year with renewed energy and fresh hopes, we will endeavour to build a positive school culture of care and strengthen pupilsâ€™ resilience while encouraging them to voice out, to support their peers and to practise gratitude. These are captured in our theme for 2022 - For Innova, From Innovians. Innova refers to not just the school, but the wider community surrounding the school and Innovians refer to not just pupils, but staff, parents and other stakeholders of the school. I look forward to furthering the strong partnership that the school has with all of you.

**Mr Yee**
