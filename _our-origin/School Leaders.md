Message from Principal
----------------------


Welcome to Innova Primary School (IPS), where warmest greetings await you!

At IPS, we embrace a powerful theme that extends beyond the confines of our school walls - "For Innova, from Innovians" reminds us that Innova encompasses not just the school itself but also our vibrant neighbourhood and the nurturing environments of our students' homes. Innovians, likewise, encompasses not only our students but also our dedicated teachers, school staff, parents, neighbours, community partners, and the esteemed members of our School Advisory Committee (SAC). We believe in fostering a strong sense of community among our students, encouraging them to realise their place within a larger network of support and collaboration.

We firmly believe that parents are instrumental in their children's holistic development, and we invite you to join forces with us in creating an environment that sparks a lifelong love for learning, nurtures innovation and creativity, and cultivates essential life skills. We place great value on regular and open communication with parents, not just regarding academic achievements but encompassing all facets of their children's education. We should not reduce children to numbers and discuss their development only in terms of test (assessment) scores. Instead, we need to recognize the uniqueness of each child's educational journey and foster their growth as multifaceted individuals.

Besides parents, our cherished neighbours, community partners, and our SAC members are pivotal in our students' educational journey. Your partnerships and expertise enrich our students' school experiences, providing them with learning opportunities that transcend the boundaries of our school.

We would like to invite all of you to co-create school experiences that empower our students to become confident, resilient, and successful individuals, poised to make a positive difference in the world.

Thank you for being part of our vibrant community. Together, we will inspire and shape the future leaders of tomorrow.
