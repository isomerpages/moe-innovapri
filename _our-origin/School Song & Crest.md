This is the school where stars and champions are born, and anchored on values.  
We hope to inspire in them the passion for life-long learning,  
ability to adapt to changes and imbue in them the desire, discipline and dedication  
as a committed individual with a global mindset.

The Letter “I” which begins from the base as a stroke of a paint brush represents  
the importance of being anchored on values and purpose. As it reaches the top,  
the digitized format represents being relevant to the present and ready for the future.  
The orange colour symbolizes the vibrant and dynamic environment in the school.  
The Red Star which is dancing and rejoicing represents a bright and happy pupil  
of Innova celebrating success. It embodies the Chinese name of Innova,  
**星****烁小****学** which connotes the potential of the pupils to be “bright and shining stars”.

The school motto **"Dare to Dream"** in italics represents the spirit of Innovation and Enterprise,  
	where our pupils continually make things better through experimentation, creation and innovation.
	
### **School Song**

We aim for excellence with the base of integrity  
We are young  
We dare to dream  
We do believe

We’ll be champions of character  
To always strive to be better  
We serve our Nation with pride and passion  
Regardless where we are

We have the strength to persevere  
We know we can achieve  
We are young  
We dare to dream  
We do believe

We will be champions of change  
We can rise to challenges  
We will realise our potential  
Let’s lead by example

**_Chorus:_**  
Innova is our name  
This is the school to be  
Working hand in hand  
Help each other to succeed  
Innova is our name  
i-STAR in you and me  
Together we create  
Our future for all to see  
We Dare to Dream
